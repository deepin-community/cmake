    <p>
      CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to
      build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software
      compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent
      configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that
      can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CMake Qt GUI provides an easy-to-use interface to configure your
      build and customize settings.
